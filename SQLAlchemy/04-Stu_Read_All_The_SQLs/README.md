# Read All the SQL

In this activity, the task is to query an external server by using Pandas and SQLAlchemy to create new DataFrames on U.S. Census data.

## Instructions

* Create an engine to connect to the Census database.

* Query all the data from the `Census_Data` table, and load it into Pandas.

* Create an engine to connect to the zip database.

* Query all the data from the `Zip_Census` table, and load it in Pandas.

* Show the `.head()` of your newly imported data.

## Bonus

Use Pandas’s `merge` to combine the two DataFrames.
